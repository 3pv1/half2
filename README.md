=============

A recreation (and working version) of the Half-Life 2 beta, complete in the original beta engine.

Currently being worked on by:

Frequently asked questions (and answers!):

Q. Is this a mod like Missing Information?
A. No. We're using the original HL2 beta engine.

Q. Is this illegal?
A. At this point, I don't think Valve cares. HL2 is already out and has sold millions of copies,
so there's not really any danger of "remaking" the beta. We're not even charging for it.

Q. Are people free to work on this?
A. As long as you have our (the creators) permission, sure, why not?

Q. Are you remaking everything?
A. Only the things that are untextured or need to be remastered. Basically, we'll fix everything and nothing at the
same time.

Q. When will this be released?
A. We don't know. However, everyone's free to download the project data at anytime and compile the source code by themselves :)

Q. What is your reason for doing this project in the first place?
A. I think you'd be better off contacting [Jack](http://steamcommunity.com/profiles/76561198042786821/) instead.
